# 🌐 Multi-Cloud Architecture Demo

This project demonstrates a basic **multi-cloud architecture** setup where services interact across **two cloud platforms**, showcasing **interoperability** in a distributed cloud system. The frontend is hosted on one platform (e.g., local server or AWS/GCP), and the backend uses **Firebase Realtime Database** as a lightweight, scalable backend service.

---

## ✅ Project Objective

The primary goal of this task is to simulate and visualize a basic **multi-cloud integration**, where frontend services hosted in one cloud environment fetch and display data from a backend hosted in another cloud platform.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5 & CSS3** – For building the frontend interface.
- **JavaScript (Fetch API)** – To make API requests and retrieve data from Firebase.
- **Firebase Realtime Database** – Serves as the cloud-hosted backend database.
- **Live Server / Python HTTP Server** – To run the project locally without CORS issues.
